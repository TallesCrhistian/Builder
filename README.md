# Builder Pattern in C#
This repository contains an example implementation of the Builder design pattern in C#. The goal is to demonstrate how the Builder pattern can be used to build complex objects in a flexible and modular way.

## Overview
The Builder design pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. It is useful when creating an object involves multiple steps or customizable options.

In this example, we created a car construction system in a factory. Each car can have different models, colors, and engine features. We used the Builder pattern to construct cars with different option configurations in a flexible and modular way.

## Project Structure
Program.cs: The main file containing the source code of the challenge, including the definitions of the Car, ICarBuilder, CarSportBuilder, Director classes, and the Main method.

## How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
Compile and run the program to see the Builder pattern in action in building cars.
